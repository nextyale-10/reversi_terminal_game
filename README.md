I wrote 2 classes, one for Main and one for State. State is used to print out the board and to track the current status on the board.
Main is a class to start game. You can follow the prompts printed by Main to finish the game.

Heuristic function F(State) =#of own(current player) stones+ 3*#own stones at corner

PS: You can enter “h” for help at every time  when you cannot find a place to move.
